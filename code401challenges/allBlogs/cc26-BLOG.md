## Blog Notes: Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is the most basic sorting algorithm available. It builds the final list by iterating making one repetition at a time. It iterates over each element and places it to it's respective position.

## Algorithm
The algorithm is less efficient than other sorting algorithms such as quiksort, heapsort, etc since it goes through each element to find the right spot. That is O(n^2). Even if the array is sorted, the algorithm goes through each elements and puts it back to the same place. When people manually sort playing cards, most use a method similar to insertion sort.

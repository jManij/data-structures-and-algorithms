# Challenge Summary
Implement Binary Tree and BST. 

## Challenge Description
Implment tree traversal (in order, preorder and postorder for Binary tree) and write add and contains method for BST. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(LogN) since at worst scenario, we traverse logn times.
O(1) for space complexity since we are not storing the contents of the tree when we traverse.
